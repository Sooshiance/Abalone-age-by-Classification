# Password Hasher

<img src="./preview/hasher.png" />

This is a browser extension that can receives a random string and hash it with **`SHA-2`** algorithm.

I will set some icon image for it to make it looks tidy.

Here's how it works :

<a href="#firefox">firefox</a>

## Firefox

Open the Firefox developer edition go to this path :

**`about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`**

click the **`Load Temporary Add-on...`**

load the `manifest.json` file and now your add-on should serves you well.

of course it doesn't has any icons.

I will add them as soon as possible.
